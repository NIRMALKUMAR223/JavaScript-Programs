----> Types Of Function

----> named function.
    function function_name(){

    }

----> function expression. // conditional rendering
    lhs  =  rhs;

----> anonymous function.
    const add = function (number){

    }

----> arrow function.
    ES6 => fat arrow 
    ()=>{

    }

----> immidiate invoked function expression (IIFE).
----> higher order function.
----> callback function.

Function():

=> Function is a block of code which is used to do some specific task.
=> We can write any bussniess with in that function block.
=> To excute that function we have to triger it by calling the function using function name.
=> In javascript function are created in many ways.

    * named function.
    * function expression. // conditional rendering
    * anonymous function.
    * arrow function.
    * immidiate invoked function expression (IIFE).
    * higher order function.
    * callback function.

=>Named function.

    * To create a named function we have to function keyword along with the identifier, 
      and paranthsis for the parameter with a block {}.
    
    example:
        function print(){
            console.log('i am function');
        }
        print();

        function fullName(first, last){
            return 'hello ' + first +' '+ last;
        }
        fullName('nirmal', 'kumar');

=>Function expression. // conditional rendering

    * In javascript function can be stored in an variable.
    * Storing a function in an variable is known as function expression.

    example:
        var add = function(a,b){
            console.log(a+b);
        }

        add(10,20);

=>Anonymous function.

    * In javascript we can create anonymous function with out using identifier.
    * But we have to store that in an variable.

    example:
        var add = function(a,b){
            console.log(a+b);
        }

        add(10,20);

=>Arrow function.

    * In javascript arrow function was introduced in ES6 feature.
    * We don't have to use function keyword. 
    * We don't have to use identifier.
    * To create arrow function we have to use paranthsis for parameters along with fat (=>) arrow.
    * If there is only one parameter then paranthsis is not manitory. 
    * If there is only one statment clever {} braces is not manitory.
    * If there is only one return statment then clever braces and return keyword is not manitory. 
    * If we are using return keyword explicity the we have to clever {} braces.

    Note:

        * Arrow function should be stored in a variable.
    
    example:

        // Two parameter
            const add = (a,b) => {
                return a+b;
            }
        
        // zero parameter
            const print = () => {
                return 'welcome';
            } 
        
        // one parameter 
            const user = () => user;

=>immidiate invoked function expression (IIFE).

    * Such type of function which is called immidiately after creating it.
    * This types of function excute only for one time .
    * In order to create an IIFE we have to wrap the function inside the paranthsis and we can call that function 
      by giving another paranthsis.

    example:

        (function xyz(){
            console.log('hello world');
        })();

        (()=>{
            console.log("helloworld);
        })();

        ((name)=>{
            console.log(`my name is ${name});
        })('Nirmal Kumar);

=>higher order function.

    * Those function which accept another as its argument is known as higher order function.
    * We have to specify the perticular parameter is accepting a function by calling  it inside the function scope.
    * Higher order function return an another function.
    * It is generally used in such cases where the code is reusable .

    example:

        // 1

        var fun = (user, password, a)=>{
            user(a);
            password();
        }

        fun ( (a)=>{
            console.log(a+ ' i am user');
        }, ()=>{
            console.log('i am password')
        });
        
        // 2

        var calc = (operator, number1, number2)=>{
            operator(number1, number2);
        }

        calc((num1, num2)=>{
            console.log(num1! + num2);
        }, 10, 20);


=>callback function
    
    * The function which is passed as a parameter inside the higher order function is known as callback function.


=>Nested function
    
    * Function inside a function is known as Nested function

    example: 

    var nest = ()=>{
        console.log('i am parent function');

        var child = ()=>{
            console.log('i am child function');

            var grandChild = ()=>{
                console.log('i am grand child');
            }
            grandChild();
        }
        child();
    }

    nest();

=>Closure

    * Closure was introduced in ES6 version.
    * Closure is nothing but the temperory storage where all the data member of a function is temperory stored.
    * If the child function wants to access the data member they can access by using Closure.
    * It is function where the logic for storing the data member of the function is temperory is written.



  
///////////   first code

console.log('start')

var a = 50;
var b = 20;

function abc(){
    return a+b;
}

console.log(abc());
console.log('hello');

function first(){
    var c = a;
    console.log(c);
}

first();
console.log('end')


////////// second code

function parent(a,b){
    
    var c = 50;
    
    function child(){
        console.log(c+10);
        var d = 100;
        console.log(d+c);
    }

    var e = 200;
    
    child();
} 

parent(10, 5);
console.log('bye bye');

=>Execution context

    * Every time an javascript file is created for that js file 
    * One execution context is created that is known as global execution context 
    * For every execution context there are two phases
        ----->variable phase
        ----->execution phase
    
    * variable phase and execution phase
        
        =>In the variable phase are stored in the heap memory  with the default value undefined.
        =>In the execution phase all the variables get their values and all the executed line get executed.
        =>whenever there is a function , we need to call that function in order to execute it.
        =>whenever the function calling statment is their for that function new execution context is created along with the variable phase and execution phase.

=>Array
    
    * Array is collection of data 
    * Unlike normal variable array variable is able to store multiple data at the same time
    * In javascript arrays are heterogeneous 

    Syntax:

        => Literal way
            
            const arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];
            const other = []; // empty array

        => Using new keyword
        
            const otherWay = new Array();
            const anotherWay = new Array(5);

        =>Adding element to an array

            arr[0] = value;
            arr[1] = value;
            arr[2] = value;
            arr[3] = value;
            arr[4] = value;

    Note:

        If we are adding less number of elements than the length of the array then it create hole in the array
        To avoid the holes in the array we have to enter data in all the indexes and more

    Fetching element in array:

        var user = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];
        
        // using for loop

            for (let i = 0; i < user.length; i++ ){
                console.log(user[i]);
            }

        // using while loop

            index = 0;
            while (index < user.length){
                console.log(user[index]);
                index++;
            }

        // using forEach

            user.forEach( (item)=>{
                console.log(item)
            });
